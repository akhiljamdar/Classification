# Naive Bayes Classification
The purpose of this repository is to explore Naive Bayes Classification in Python with ML Algorithms

## Introduction 
The data is consist of various features of  medical reports ('Pregnancies', 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin',
 'BMI', 'DiabetesPedigreeFunction', 'Age', 'Outcome'). Here the target variable is outcome. 
 
 ## Model
 We can use Naive Bayes Classification beacause it predicts membership probabilities for each class such as the probability that given record or data point belongs to a particular class. The class with the highest probability is considered as the most likely class.
 
 
 
 # Accuracy 
 Accuracy of model says how many  percentage of model is accurate.
 
 # Sample Deployement 
 We here use test sample data were all feature is same as model data but only dependent variable is absent. So We can predict the dependent variable based on above model.
